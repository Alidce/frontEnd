? ¡°Up & Going¡±: Are you new to programming and JS? This is the roadmap you
need to consult as you start your learning journey.
? ¡°Scope & Closures¡±: Did you know that JS lexical scope is based on compiler (not
interpreter!) semantics? Can you explain how closures are a direct result of lexical
scope and functions as values?
? ¡°this & Object Prototypes¡±: Can you recite the four simple rules for how this is
bound? Have you been muddling through fake ¡°classes¡± in JS instead of adopting
the simpler ¡°behavior delegation¡± design pattern? Ever heard of OLOO?
? ¡°Types & Grammar¡±: Do you know the built-in types in JS, and more importantly
do you know how to properly and safely use coercion between types? How comfortable
are you with the nuances of JS grammar/syntax?
? ¡°Async & Performance¡±: Are you still using callbacks to manage your asynchrony?
Can you explain what a promise is and why/how it solves ¡°callback hell¡±, and how
generators improve the legibility of async code? What exactly constitutes mature
optimization of JS programs and individual operations?
