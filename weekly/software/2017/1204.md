**React v16.2.0: Improved Support for Fragments**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/11/28/react-v16.2.0-fragment-support.html  
React 16.2 is now available! The biggest addition is improved support for returning multiple children from a component’s render method. We call this feature fragments. 另附：[Debugging React performance with React 16 and Chrome Devtools](https://building.calibreapp.com/debugging-react-performance-with-react-16-and-chrome-devtools-c90698a522ad)、[11 React Component Libraries You Should Know In 2018](https://blog.bitsrc.io/11-react-component-libraries-you-should-know-178eb1dd6aa4)。

**Orinoco: young generation garbage collection**  
https://v8project.blogspot.ca/2017/11/orinoco-parallel-scavenger.html  
JavaScript objects in V8 are allocated on a heap managed by V8’s garbage collector. In previous blog posts we have already talked about how we reduce garbage collection pause times (more than once) and memory consumption. In this blog post we introduce the parallel Scavenger, one of the latest features of Orinoco, V8’s mostly concurrent and parallel garbage collector and discuss design decisions and alternative approaches we implemented on the way.

**An Introduction to Speculative Optimization in V8**

**Monitoring the performance of a Node.js web application**  
https://blog.sqreen.io/diy-node-apm/  
Building a tool to monitor how an application performs is not very difficult anymore. Two recent additions to Node.js, the Async Hooks API and the Performance Hooks API, allow anyone to closely monitor the performance of their app with just a little code. This article explains the key elements to building such a tool, from instrumenting code to reporting collected data in a clear visualisation.

**Why Flutter Will Take Off in 2018**  
https://codeburst.io/why-flutter-will-take-off-in-2018-bbd75f8741b0  
I plan to blog on some of the iOS apps I am now re-writing using Flutter, rather than React Native. Note that I have used a bit of React Native in the past, and React for web apps extensively, I still think Flutter will take off in 2018. Here’s why.

**What is ReasonML?**  
http://2ality.com/2017/11/about-reasonml.html  
[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) is a new object-functional programming language created at Facebook. In essence, it is a new C-like syntax for the programming language OCaml. The new syntax is intended to make interoperation with JavaScript and adoption by JavaScript programmers easier. 另附： [Getting started with ReasonML](http://2ality.com/2017/11/getting-started-reasonml.html)、[What is planned for ReasonML?](http://2ality.com/2017/12/future-reasonml.html)。

**WebGL 基础知识**  
http://eux.baidu.com/blog/2017/11/832  
OpenGL Embeded Subset是OpenGL的一个子集, 针对嵌入式和移动端做了功能精简和性能优化。WebGL基于OpenGL ES 2.0标准,基本就是将原来C语言的API和配置项迁移到Javascript, 去掉了一些实在不兼容的部分，WebGL 2.0基于OpenGL ES 3.0。

**如何为 ThinkJS 3 网站优化 TTFB 时间**  
https://imququ.com/post/reduce-ttfb-on-thinkjs3-website.html  
Time to first byte（简称 TTFB）时间，又称首字节时间，是 WEB 性能优化中非常重要的指标。它代表着从浏览器发起 HTTP 请求到收到 HTTP 响应第一个字节的这段时间，包含了 DNS 解析、建立 TCP 连接、建立 SSL 连接、发送 HTTP 请求、网络传输、服务端处理、30X 重定向等阶段。在影响 TTFB 所有因素中，服务端程序何时输出响应决定了服务端处理时间的长短，也是本文关注的优化目标。

**Improving Resiliency and Stability of a Large-scale Monolithic API Service**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/11/improving-resiliency-and-stability-of-a-large-scale-api  
How do you increase the resiliency and stability of a monolithic API service that is used by three different platforms, serving 500+ million members, developed by over 400 engineers, deployed three times per day, and consuming almost 300 downstream services? The API layer service used by LinkedIn.com and the LinkedIn mobile applications is one such service, and in this post, we want to share with you how we increased its resiliency and stability.

In this article, we'll explore a technique called "FLIP" that can be used to animate the positions and dimensions of any DOM element in a performant manner, regardless of how their layout is calculated or rendered (e.g., height, width, floats, absolute positioning, transform, flexbox, grid, etc.)

**The Best Request Is No Request, Revisited**  
https://alistapart.com/article/the-best-request-is-no-request-revisited  
Over the last decade, web performance optimization has been controlled by one indisputable guideline: the best request is no request. A very humble rule, easy to interpret. Every network call for a resource eliminated improves performance. Every src attribute spared, every link element dropped. But everything has changed now that HTTP/2 is available, hasn’t it? Designed for the modern web, HTTP/2 is more efficient in responding to a larger number of requests than its predecessor. So the question is: does the old rule of reducing requests still hold up?

**Scaffolding a NodeJS GraphQL API server**  
https://medium.com/@tomlagier/scaffolding-a-rock-solid-graphql-api-b651c2a36438  
Recently, I’ve been working on a new full-stack project and I wanted to take the opportunity to try my hand at creating a GraphQL API. I didn’t find many resources that walked through the whole stack on the back-end from DB to ORM to API design, including tests, so I thought I could help some other folks by laying out what I ended up with.

**A Year in Computer Vision: The M Tank, 2017**  
http://www.themtank.org/a-year-in-computer-vision  
The term understanding provides an interesting counterpoint to an otherwise mechanical definition of vision, one which serves to demonstrate both the significance and complexity of the Computer Vision field. True understanding of our environment is not achieved through visual representations alone. Rather, visual cues travel through the optic nerve to the primary visual cortex and are interpreted by the brain, in a highly stylised sense. The interpretations drawn from this sensory information encompass the near-totality of our natural programming and subjective experiences, i.e. how evolution has wired us to survive and what we learn about the world throughout our lives.

**Interface**  
https://spectrum.chat/thread/ac4cba39-0582-4b73-9582-9e863ed66346  
In this post, I’m going to lay out a case for an intermediary format between design and engineering tools to enable more efficient, capable tooling for product teams generally and designers especially. This proposal is based on a series of conversations I’ve had with small groups of designers and engineers over the past year or so.

Designers are more than systems, designers solve problems in unconventional and fun ways that a system wouldn't be able to generate. Designers are human, just like our users and I don’t think that’s something anyone should forget.

**A Big List of Typography Books**  
http://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/big-list-typography-books/  
A book on typography has no choice but to have incredibly typography itself, so while you read and learn, you get to linger on the typesetting of the book itself. Although I bet that runs counter to what the authors want! They are always saying good typography shouldn’t call attention to itself but get out of the way.

**Designing For A Browserless Web**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/11/designing-for-a-browserless-web/  
Users couldn’t care less about whether a technology is native, an installed web app or a website. What makes users engage and makes shoppers convert is really the experience itself. In this article, Mitch takes a closer look at PWAs on Android devices and explains how we can pave the way for a new era of browserless web browsing.

**The Mythical UX Designer – Five Common Misconceptions**  
https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/the-mythical-ux-designer-five-common-misconceptions/  
UX is not only about technology and technical constraints, but about the intersection of business goals, user needs, and technology. UX designers have strong design backgrounds; UX designers have to be able to code; UX portfolios have to be beautiful; UX designers are obsessed with technology and gadgets; UX designers always wear black.

几乎每个系统都受到多种因素的影响，所以若要理解这样的系统，就必须熟练地运用来自不同学科的多元思维方式。你必须意识到，生活无非就是一个接一个的联系。所以，你必须拥有各种模型，你必须弄清楚各种模型的相互关系以及它们的效应，你必须辨认出这些事情之间的关系。如果你把自己训练得更加客观，拥有更多学科的知识，那么你在考虑事物的时候，就能够超越那些比你聪明得多的人。

用最简单的方法解决一个实际问题并且想象它未来的样子是十分必要的。做互联网产品时，经常思考怎样把线下的场景搬到线上去，会有更棒的解决方案。此外，要打造一个成功的产品，就要用手术刀一般精细的技法去雕刻产品。在做商业产品设计时，要面向场景设计，不断想象和模拟商业活动中的场景。当发现产品机会时，需要大胆假设，快速验证，持续优化。面向商业流程设计，细致洞察用户最想要什么，切中要害，化繁为简，让普通商家也能理解产品功能，这样才能让产品快速覆盖到商业体系中。强运营、头部商户对拉动平台活跃是十分重要的，但到了中后期就需要系统化、产品化的思路才能实现大规模的用户层覆盖。怎样做出自己有而竞争对手没有的东西，才是跟竞争对手甩开身位的关键。另一点是聚焦，看准一个点，把它做到完美。
