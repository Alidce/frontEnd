**Why I No Longer Use MVC Frameworks**  
http://www.infoq.com/articles/no-more-mvc-frameworks  
The worst part of my job these days is designing APIs for front-end developers. The conversation goes inevitably as:Dev – So, this screen has data element x,y,z… could you please create an API with the response format {x: , y:, z: } Me – Ok. I don’t even argue anymore. Projects end up with a gazillion APIs tied to screens that change often, which, by “design” require changes in the API and before you know it, you end up with lots of APIs and for each API many form factors and platform variants. A couple of months ago, I started a journey to understand why we ended up here and what could be done about it, a journey that lead me to question the strongest dogma in application architecture, MVC, and where I touched the sheer power of reactive and functional programming, a journey focused on simplicity and scraping the bloat that our industry is so good at producing.

**Why ‘mobile first’ may already be outdated**  
https://blog.intercom.com/why-mobile-first-may-already-be-outdated/
If “mobile first” is no longer your dogma, then what is? At Intercom our dogma is the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. Focusing on what Jobs your users are trying to do. Servicing those Jobs where they happen. Servicing them with the right depth of product experience: maybe a glance on a watch is best, maybe a 40 inch screen dashboard view is best. Servicing them in a way that takes advantage of the situational context of use – no one is bringing their iMac to the beach, and no-one is writing the board deck on their phone. So think about the screen best suited for input, and the screen best suited for output.

**Ten Extras for Great API Documentation**  
https://alistapart.com/article/ten-extras-for-great-api-documentation  
If you manage to create amazing API documentation and ensure that developers have a positive experience implementing your API, they will sing the praises of your product. Continuously improving your API documentation is an investment, but it can have a huge impact. Great documentation builds trust, differentiates you from your competition, and provides marketing value.

**THE MAGIC OF CSS**  
http://adamschwartz.co/magic-of-css/
CSS is a mess. We all love it, but it’s a mess. I liken it to English: there are a bunch of rules, and you can learn them. But sometimes you’re better off just trying shit and seeing what works and what doesn’t. Magic is a codification of what I’ve learned in that crazy process. The material in this textbook is intermediate-to-advanced. It assumes an understanding of the CSS syntax, cascading and inheritance, and commonly used selectors. It also assumes you’ve had enough experience with CSS to have learned not to make these common mistakes anymore.

**Earth on AWS - Build planetary-scale applications in the cloud with open geospatial data**  
https://aws.amazon.com/earth/  
Landsat 8 data is available for anyone to use via Amazon S3. All Landsat 8 scenes from 2015 are available along with a selection of cloud-free scenes from 2013 and 2014. All new Landsat 8 scenes are made available each day, often within hours of production. The satellite images the entire Earth every 16 days at a roughly 30 meter resolution. 

**10 Lessons of an MIT Education**

You can and will work at a desk for seven hours straight, routinely. By and large, "knowing how" matters more than "knowing what." You don't have to be a genius to do creative work. The future belongs to the computer-literate-squared... 

**The System Design Primer**  
https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer
Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer. System design is a broad topic. There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on system design principles. This repo is an organized collection of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

**Fast For-In in V8**  
https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/03/fast-for-in-in-v8.html  
For-in is a widely used language feature present in many frameworks. Despite its ubiquity, it is one of the more obscure language constructs from an implementation perspective. V8 went to great lengths to make this feature as fast as possible. Over the course of the past year, for-in became fully spec compliant and up to 3 times faster, depending on the context.

这又是一篇劝大家“不要盲目崇拜”的文章，不过这次我列出了一长串有用的清单，或许能够帮助你们做出更好的决定。如果你还在使用 Google 搜索新技术来重建你的软件架构，那么我建议你不要再这么做了。相反，你可以考虑应用 UNPHAT 原则：在彻底了解（Understand）你的问题之前，不要急着去寻找解决方案。你的目标应该是在问题领域内“解决”问题，而不是在方案领域内解决问题；列出（eNumerate）多种方案，不要只把眼睛盯在你最喜欢的方案上；选择一个候选方案，并阅读相关论文（Paper）；了解候选方案的产生背景（Historical context）；比较优点（Advantages）和缺点，扬长避短；思考（Think），冷静地思考候选方案是否适合用于解决你的问题。

**APIs as infrastructure: future-proofing Stripe with versioning**  
https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning  
When it comes to APIs, change isn’t popular. While software developers are used to iterating quickly and often, API developers lose that flexibility as soon as even one user starts consuming their interface.

**A Brief, Incomplete History of JavaScript**  
https://closebrace.com/articles/2017-09-11/a-brief-incomplete-history-of-javascript  
In 2017, JavaScript development can leave newcomers to the language—and many veterans—paralyzed, unsure of where to begin or which paths are the right ones to take. People often dive into the latest-and-greatest without any real understanding of why it’s so great (or why it might not be). Understanding JavaScript's history can help make sense of its current state.

**The end of Framework Churn**  
http://blog.ionic.io/the-end-of-framework-churn/  
We believe 2017 is the year that web developers finally start to use Web Components in larger numbers. It’s going to take some time to reach mainstream usage, but the benefits are real and native support is improving rapidly. The era of Framework churn is coming to an end, and now we can all go back to working on what makes our apps unique instead of spending precious time, energy, and money jumping to something new every year.

**HTTP is obsolete. It's time for the Distributed Web**  
https://blog.neocities.org/blog/2015/09/08/its-time-for-the-distributed-web.html  
Neocities has collaborated with Protocol Labs to become the first major site to implement IPFS in production. Starting today, all Neocities web sites are available for viewing, archiving, and hosting by any IPFS node in the world. When another IPFS node chooses to host a site from Neocities, that version of the site will continue to be available, even if Neocities shuts down or stops hosting it. The more IPFS nodes seed Neocities sites, the more available (and redundant) Neocities sites become. And the less centrally dependent the sites are on us to continue existing.
