**React v16.0**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html  
Among the changes are some long-standing feature requests, including fragments, error boundaries, portals, support for custom DOM attributes, improved server-side rendering, and reduced file size. Although React 16 includes significant internal changes, in terms of upgrading, you can think of this like any other major React release. We’ve been serving React 16 to Facebook and Messenger.com users since earlier this year, and we released several beta and release candidate versions to flush out additional issues. With minor exceptions, if your app runs in 15.6 without any warnings, it should work in 16. 附：[React 16: A look inside an API-compatible rewrite of our frontend UI library](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1716776591680069/react-16-a-look-inside-an-api-compatible-rewrite-of-our-frontend-ui-library/)、[What’s New With Server-Side Rendering in React 16](https://hackernoon.com/whats-new-with-server-side-rendering-in-react-16-9b0d78585d67)、[Leverage New Features of React 16](https://egghead.io/courses/leverage-new-features-of-react-16)、[React v15.6.2](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/25/react-v15.6.2.html)、[Relicensing GraphQL spec.

**7 architectural attributes of a reliable React component**  
https://dmitripavlutin.com/7-architectural-attributes-of-a-reliable-react-component/  
When writing a React application, I regularly ask myself: How to correctly structure the component?
At what point a big component should split into smaller components? How to design a communication between components that prevents tight coupling? Luckily, reliable components have common characteristics. Let's study these 7 useful criterias, and detail into case studies.

**Node8’s util.promisify is so freakin’ awesome!**  
https://hackernoon.com/node8s-util-promisify-is-so-freakin-awesome-1d90c184bf44  
util.promisifyconverts a regular function into an async function, i.e. a function that returns a promise. The function passed to util.promisify must follow the NodeJS callback style. The function must pass a callback as the last parameter, and the callback must be the take the following parameters in the following order: (err, value) => { /* … */ }. Promisifed functions can be used with await and async to help avoid messy promise chains an introduce a cleaner, saner, way to do asynchronous programming.

**The Coming Software Apocalypse**  
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/?single_page=true  
Software is different. Just by editing the text in a file somewhere, the same hunk of silicon can become an autopilot or an inventory-control system. This flexibility is software’s miracle, and its curse. Because it can be changed cheaply, software is constantly changed; and because it’s unmoored from anything physical—a program that is a thousand times more complex than another takes up the same actual space—it tends to grow without bound. “The problem,” Leveson wrote in a book, “is that we are attempting to build systems that are beyond our ability to intellectually manage.”

**Web Truths: JavaScript can’t be trusted**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2017/09/26/web-truths-javascript-cant-be-trusted/  
JavaScript is a fair-weather friend and can break in many ways. You may also block out a lot of users because you crave more control over things you aren’t meant to control. There is a flip-side to this truth though. JavaScript has evolved from a scripting language in the browser to a development environment in its own right. The rise of Node and other server-side and embedded systems put JavaScript on the map as a key skill of our market. JavaScript isn’t a client-side problem, it is a whole bigger set of offers these days.

**A Large-Scale Study of Programming Languages and Code Quality in GitHub**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2017/10/221326-a-large-scale-study-of-programming-languages-and-code-quality-in-github/fulltext  
The data indicates that functional languages are better than procedural languages; it suggests that disallowing implicit type conversion is better than allowing it; that static typing is better than dynamic; and that managed memory usage is better than unmanaged. Further, that the defect proneness of languages in general is not associated with software domains. Additionally, languages are more related to individual bug categories than bugs overall.

**[译]Go语言：成长的十年**  
http://tonybai.com/2017/09/24/go-ten-years-and-climbing/  
Go语言之父 Rob Pike 代表Go语言发表了一篇名为《Go: Ten years and climbing》的文章，用以纪念Go语言从最初的设计idea起到目前的十年发展。第一次关于 Go 语言设计的讨论是在2007年9月20日，今天，Go已经成为云计算语言。想象一下：一个只有10岁的年轻编程语言已经成为这样一个规模庞大且不断发展的行业的主导者，这样的成功以前只是存在于在想象中。如果你觉得“主导”这个词太过强势的话，让我们来看看中国互联网行业。一段时间以来，Go在中国地区大量使用的数据一度让我们误认为Google趋势图出现了某些错误，但是凡是去过中国，参加过中国区Go语言大会的人都可以证实：Google趋势图的数据是真的，Go在中国的使用非常火爆！

把测试覆盖作为质量目标没有任何意义，我们应该把它作为一种发现未被测试覆盖的代码的手段。

**CSS font-display: The Future of Font Rendering on the Web**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/css-font-display-future-font-rendering-web/  
One of the downsides of using web fonts is that if a font is not available on a user’s device, it must be downloaded. In the course of time, browsers have adopted several strategies to mitigate this problem. Enter the font-display descriptor for the @font-face at-rule. This CSS feature introduces a way to standardize these behaviors and provide more control to developers.

**Web performance in the real world: how to make fast websites**  
https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/Microsoft-Edge-Web-Summit-2017/ES15  
There is boundless advice out there on how to improve web performance. Some folks will tell you to avoid complex CSS selectors, others will tell you to reduce your JavaScript bundle size, and others will recommend fancy Babel plugins to Webpack your worries away. In this talk, I'll explore some of the work the Microsoft Edge team does to help website authors build faster sites, and in particular how to think of performance as an investigative activity, beyond the checklist approach.

**Sensors For The Web!**  
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/sensors-for-the-web/  
Sensor data is used in many native applications to enable use cases such as immersive gaming, fitness tracking, and augmented or virtual reality. Wouldn't it be cool to bridge the gap between native and web applications? The [Generic Sensor API](https://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor/), For The Web!

**LibSlack: the C++ library at the foundation of our client application architecture**  
https://slack.engineering/libslack-the-c-library-at-the-foundation-of-our-client-application-architecture-97470b5ef9b3  
Slack ships its client application on many different platforms. Initially these different platform applications were developed independently at Slack, with separate teams and codebases for each of the mobile platforms and the desktop. About a year ago, Slack formed a new team, LibSlack, to develop a cross-platform C++ library to encapsulate common functionality and integrate it into client apps. LibSlack is currently in use in the Slack iOS and Android apps, with a plan to expand to other platforms.

**Multithreaded rendering on Android with Litho and Infer**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/1985913448333055/multithreaded-rendering-on-android-with-litho-and-infer/  
By taking advantage of the unique capabilities offered by two Facebook open source projects — [Litho](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1187475984695956/open-sourcing-litho-a-declarative-ui-framework-for-android/) and [Infer](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1648953042007882/open-sourcing-facebook-infer-identify-bugs-before-you-ship/) — we were able to design a platform that ensures each story renders quickly and reliably regardless of its content, and provides these assurances by default so engineers can focus on shipping great products without performance concerns.

**Serving 100 Gbps from an Open Connect Appliance**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/serving-100-gbps-from-an-open-connect-appliance-cdb51dda3b99  
In the summer of 2015, the Netflix Open Connect CDN team decided to take on an ambitious project. The goal was to leverage the new 100GbE network interface technology just coming to market in order to be able to serve at 100 Gbps from a single FreeBSD-based Open Connect Appliance (OCA) using NVM Express (NVMe)-based storage. At the time, the bulk of our flash storage-based appliances were close to being CPU limited serving at 40 Gbps using single-socket Xeon E5–2697v2.

**Migrating a database from InnoDB to MyRocks**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/1478526992216557/migrating-a-database-from-innodb-to-myrocks/  
Last year, we introduced [MyRocks](http://myrocks.io/), our new MySQL database engine, with the goal of improving space and write efficiency beyond what was possible with compressed InnoDB. Our objective was to migrate one of our main databases (UDB) from compressed InnoDB to MyRocks and reduce the amount of storage and number of servers used by half. We carefully planned and implemented the migration from InnoDB to MyRocks for our UDB tier, which manages data about Facebook’s social graph. We completed the migration last month, and successfully cut our storage usage in half. This post describes how we prepared for and executed the migration, and what lessons we learned along the way.

**Adcash - 1 Trillion HTTP Requests Per Month**  
http://highscalability.com/blog/2017/9/25/adcash-1-trillion-http-requests-per-month.html  
Adcash is a worldwide advertising platform. It belongs to a category called DSP (demand-side platform). A DSP is a platform where anyone can buy traffic from many different adnetworks. Our tech stack evolved a lot during the time, we try to keep our architecture modern. One internal joke is that our stack is not just cutting-edge but bleeding-edge. Eventually, with time, what was bleeding-edge yesterday is now simply modern or disappeared from our stack (like Gearman).

当你们面临毕业，面临走出校园的时候，第一，我觉得非常重要的是，你们别太不把自己当回事。当你即将离开校园的时候，你不知道当你走出校园的时候，迎接你的是不是更加挑战的社会，是不是更加难以接受的一些疑惑。第二个建议跟第一个建议貌似有点相反，就是也别太把自己当回事。虽然你们之前学的很好，在清华学了很多东西，但很不幸的是，你们走出校园之后，发现你们很多所学并不能直接应用。第三点建议可能更加有争议一点，也别太把别人当回事。因为这个时代是变化得如此之快，所以可能你周边的很多建议，不管是过去的专家，还是你后来面临的环境的同事、老同事，甚至是上级，他们的意见，他们的经验不一定是对的，这个是我们时代特有的问题。
