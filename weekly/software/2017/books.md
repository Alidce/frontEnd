This book introduces the concepts of how computer hardware works from a programmer`s point of view. A programmer`s job is to design a sequence of instructions that will cause the hardware to perform operations that solve a problem. This book looks at these instructions by exploring how C/C++ language constructs are implemented at the instruction set architecture level.
